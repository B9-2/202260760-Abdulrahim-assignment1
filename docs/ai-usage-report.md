# AI Usage Report (Assignment 1)

## Tools Used & Use Cases
### ChatGPT
- **HTML structure:** Helped me plan a simple portfolio layout (About, Projects, Contact).
- **Form creation:** Suggested a correct contact form structure (labels + inputs + textarea).
- **CSS improvements:** Helped me fix layout issues (ugly form spacing, image alignment) and make the page more responsive.
- **JavaScript feature:** Helped me implement a time-based greeting and a dark/light mode toggle.

### [Other tool if used, otherwise delete]
- **GitHub** — I made a repository for the assignment and cloned it using vsc
- **Visual Studio Code (VSC)** - I used VSC through the entire work. I created files within it, wrote every file (html, css, js, docs, readme)

## Benefits & Challenges
**Benefits**
- Saved time by giving working examples quickly.
- Helped me understand common HTML/CSS patterns (forms, spacing, responsive images).

**Challenges / Limitations**
- Some suggestions needed changes to match my code style and assignment requirements.
- I had to fix small issues (wrong paths, sizing, styling differences) after testing in the browser.
- AI doesn’t know my exact folder names or screenshots, so I had to verify everything.
- In SWE363, we learned JavaScript as if it was python and when I wanted to make a dark mode feature I struggled so much

## Learning Outcomes
- Improved my CSS basics (centering images, spacing sections, making form inputs full width).
- Learned how to connect JavaScript to HTML and use `addEventListener` to make interactivity.
- Practiced debugging by checking DevTools and adjusting code.

## Responsible Use & Modifications
- I **reviewed every suggestion** and tested it in the browser.
- I **modified code** to fit my project (IDs/classes, text content, button wording, and layout).
- I checked for correctness (paths, required attributes, responsive behavior) and made changes when needed.
- I only used AI as help for ideas and examples, then rewrote/adjusted the final code myself.
