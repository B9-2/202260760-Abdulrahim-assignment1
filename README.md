# My Portfolio (Assignment 1)

## Description
This is a simple personal portfolio website for Assignment 1. It includes 3 sections: About Me, Projects, and a Contact form.

## Features
- About Me introduction
- Projects listing 2 projects along with images
- Contact form requiring name, email, and a message
- JavaScript interactivity: dark/light mode toggle

## Setup (Run Locally)
1. Download or clone this repository.
2. Open the folder in VS Code.
3. Open `index.html` in your browser or, as I did, use the VS Code Live Server extension.

## AI Use
I used AI tools (ChatGPT) to help with HTML structure, CSS styling, and JavaScript features (dark mode).
